# iFitness
## Angela Amaro and Evie Wilbur

iFitness is a project developed as the final project for Mizzou's CS/IT 4440 C#/.NET development class. 

<p>This is a WPF application to help users plan workouts. The workout-set design makes it so that users can easily structure their workouts. Users can add, edit, and delete workouts. Users can also log their workout after completion. </p>
  
<p>The calendar and weekly view make it easy to see workouts. A weekly report gives users an overview of their week as well as a grade for their workouts that week.  The grade is calculated based on completed workouts, scheduled workouts, and variety of workouts. There is a progress check feature that allows users to see a historical view of all of their data. This has the ability to sort workouts and displays the number of completed workouts per month. </p>
